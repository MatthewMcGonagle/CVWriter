        <h1> CVWriter </h1>
        <p> Welcome to the project pages for CVWriter. </p> 
        <p> CVWriter is a small library whose purpose is to provide functions to turn an XML-like source file of CV information into two formats:
        <ol> 
            <li> A Jekyll compatible .html file. This is ready to be turned into an HTML version of a CV that can be used by Jekyll to add to a website.
            <li>A Latex compatible .tex file that is ready to be turned into a .pdf file by simply processing it with `pdflatex`.
        
        </ol>
        This allows one to create two versions of a CV from a single .cv file. An example file is given by the file `info.cv` in this repository. </p>
        
        <h2> Format of .cv Files </h2>
        
        <p> The format of a .cv (as seen in `info.cv`) is as follows:
        
        <pre> 
        &lttitle&gt Your name &lt/title&gt
        
        &lttopic&gt
        Topic 1
        &ltitem&gt
        Put something about topic 1 here.
        &lt/topic&gt
        
        &lttopic&gt
        Topic 2
        &ltitem&gt
            &lttopic&gt 
            Subtopic 2a
            &ltitem&gt
            Put something about Subtopic 2a here.
            &lt/topic&gt
        
            &lttopic&gt
            Subtopic 2b
            &ltitem&gt
            Put something about Subtopic 2b here. &ltnewline&gt
            Put this &ltitalic&gt italicized text &lt/italic&gt on a new line. &ltnewline&gt
            On this new line, the user will see &lthyperlink&gt this text &lturl&gt myUrl &lt/hyperlink&gt 
                    as a link to the url myUrl.
            &lt/topic&gt
        &lt/topic&gt
        </pre>
        Each topic is put into the first column of the overall table. 
        The information after <code>&ltitem&gt</code> is put into the second column. 
        The second column is capable of having a sub-table that is captured by using subtopics.
        Subtopics are placed after the <code>&ltitem&gt</code> tag of the parent topic. </p>
        
        <p> The use of tabs and newlines is up to you. 
            The parser ignores white space after tags (including newlines and tabs). 
            Furthermore, the newlines are always ignored; so use them freely for formatting. 
            If you wish to put some text on a newline for the final output, then use the 
            <code>&ltnewline&gt</code> tag. 
        </p>
        
        <p> If you wish for text to be italicized, then put it between the <code>&ltitalic&gt</code> tag and the <code>&lt/italic&gt</code> tag.
        
        <p>For a hyperlink, put the label as it appears to the user between the 
            <code>&lthyperlink&gt</code> tag and the <code>&lturl&gt</code> tag. 
        Then put the actual url between the <code>&lturl&gt</code> tag and the <code>&lt/hyperlink&gt</code> tag. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Converting a .cv File</h2>
        
        <p> An example of how to do this is provided in <code>src/Main.hs</code> inside this repository. After the <code>.cv</code> file is opened, we parse its contents into the data type <code>CV</code> using the function <code>parseCV :: String -> Either ParseError CV</code>. The parsing uses the standard Parsec library, so it keeps track of Errors using the <code>Either</code> monad.
        
        Then we can use the function <code>convertCV :: CV -> LatexText</code> and <code>convertCV :: CV -> JekyllText</code> to turn the <code>CV</code> type into Latex text and Jekyll text, respectively.
